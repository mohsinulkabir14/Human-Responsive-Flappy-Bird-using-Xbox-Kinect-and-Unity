# Human-Responsive-Flappy-Bird-using-Xbox-Kinect-and-Unity
Traditional Flappy Bird is translated into a human responsive form, where a user would stand in front of the Kinect 
module and would act as the bird. Whenever the user jumps, the bird flaps in the gaming screen. 
The gesture has been translated using the Kinectscripts given in the Unity3D.


All the files are uploaded. The avatar, which is the bird in this case, is controlled using the DragonScript. The obstacles codes are
in the ObstacleScript. The score and the ending of the game is handled using the GameManagerScript.
